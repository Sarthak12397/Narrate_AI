I built this project as a full-stack prototype that turns narrative text into structured visual scenes. The idea was simple but ambitious: take a story, break it down into scenes, and represent them visually in a dynamic way. I vibe coded the whole thing—no strict plan, just experimenting and piecing together Node.js, Express, React, TypeScript, and Python to make it work.

One of the trickiest parts was generating images. My laptop couldn’t handle full image generation, so the pipeline would often fail—but eventually, I got it working enough to produce SVG graphics. It took a lot of trial and error, tweaking prompts and pipelines, but now every scene is represented as scalable vector images that are interactive and visually structured. This project isn’t perfect yet, but it’s a working prototype that shows how text can be transformed into visual storytelling.
